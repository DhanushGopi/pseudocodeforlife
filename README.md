# pseudocodeforlife

Hello, homies!
This is dhanush from Chennai!
I wanted to take my coding skills to the next level. So, I decided to take up a self-challenge with #pseudocodeforlife.

and I am also making rules to make this documentation more Legitimate and consistent.

Rules:
1. write all the Pseudo codes of each new logic.
2. At least one logic each day.
3. Never compromise with the quality of the code!

So, if you also want to achieve the same, you can take up the challenge and grow together!
