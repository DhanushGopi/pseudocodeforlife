<h2> pseudo code for life</h2>

<p>Hello, homies!</p>
<p>This is dhanush from Chennai, TamilNadu, India</p>
<p>I wanted to take my coding skills to the next level. So, I decided to take up a self-challenge with #pseudocodeforlife. and I am also making rules to make this documentation more Legitimate and consistent.</p>
<details>
   <summary>Rules for #pseudocodeforlife</summary>
   <ol>
   <li>write all the Pseudo codes of each new logic.</li>
   <li>At least one logic each day.</li>
   <li> Never compromise with the quality of the code!</li>
   <li>Add the Concept link for each pseudo code</li>
   </ol>
</details>

<p>So, if you also want to achieve the same, you can take up the challenge and grow together!</p>
